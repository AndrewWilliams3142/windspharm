Tools Reference
===============

These extra tools are helpful for preparing data for input to the `standard` interface. The tools are concerned with ensuring input is in the correct format for :py:class:`windspharm.standard.VectorWind` and post processing the output of :py:class:`windspharm.standard.VectorWind` method calls to recover the original dimensionality.

These tools can also be used to prepare data for input to :py:class:`spharm.Spharmt` method calls should the need arise.
